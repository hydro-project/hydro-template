## Getting Started
This is a template for a Rust project that uses [Hydro](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydro) for distributed services. To generate a project, run

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo generate gh:hydro-project/hydro-template
cd <myproject>
```

After `cd`ing into the workspace, run the sample tests

Then test the project:
```bash
cargo test
```

To learn more about the template, see the [Hydro Quickstart](https://hydro.run/docs/hydro/learn/quickstart/).
